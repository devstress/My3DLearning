# Enterprise Integration Platform — Complete Tutorial Course

> **From Beginner to Expert: Master Enterprise Integration Patterns, Scalability, and Atomic Processing with a Modern .NET 10 Platform**

This tutorial series takes you from zero to expert with the Enterprise Integration Platform (EIP). Every tutorial builds on the previous one, introducing one concept at a time with clear explanations, architecture diagrams, and real code examples from the platform.

The course is grounded in three pillars:

### 🏛️ Three Pillars of This Course

**1. Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP)** — Every tutorial maps directly to patterns from [*Enterprise Integration Patterns*](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf. You'll learn the 65 canonical patterns and how each is implemented in a modern .NET 10 platform. The EIP book is the design blueprint; this platform is the implementation.

**2. Scalability** — Enterprise integration must handle millions of messages without bottlenecks. Every tutorial explains the scalability dimension: how competing consumers distribute load, how broker partitioning avoids head-of-line blocking, how NATS/Pulsar ensure Recipient A never blocks Recipient B, and how the platform scales horizontally from a single node to thousands.

**3. Atomicity** — Zero message loss, guaranteed. Every message is either delivered or routed to a Dead Letter Queue — no silent drops. The Ack/Nack notification loopback ensures senders always know the outcome. Temporal workflows provide durable execution with saga compensation for distributed transactions. This all-or-nothing guarantee is the foundation of enterprise-grade reliability.

## How to Use This Course

1. **Start from Tutorial 01** if you are new to enterprise integration
2. **Jump to a specific tutorial** if you already know the basics and want to learn a specific pattern
3. **Each tutorial is self-contained** with context, but builds on earlier concepts
4. **Code examples reference actual platform source files** — open them side-by-side
5. **Run the coding labs and exams** to reinforce learning through hands-on practice

## 💻 Coding Labs & Exams

Every tutorial includes **runnable coding exercises** in the [`tests/TutorialLabs/`](../tests/TutorialLabs/) project:

- **Lab** (`Lab.cs`) — 7 NUnit tests per tutorial demonstrating the pattern with real platform APIs. Run them to see the pattern in action, then modify and experiment.
- **Exam** (`Exam.cs`) — 3 coding challenges per tutorial. Each challenge is a test you must complete — no multiple choice, only real code.

### Running the labs

```bash
# Run all tutorial labs and exams
dotnet test tests/TutorialLabs/TutorialLabs.csproj

# Run labs for a specific tutorial (e.g. Tutorial 09 — Content-Based Router)
dotnet test tests/TutorialLabs/TutorialLabs.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Tutorial09"

# Run only the exam for a specific tutorial
dotnet test tests/TutorialLabs/TutorialLabs.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Tutorial09.Exam"
```

### Project structure

```

```

**Total: 500 lab tests + 150 exam challenges = 522 coding exercises across all 50 tutorials.**
