# EnterpriseIntegrationPlatform – Milestones

> **To continue development, tell the AI agent:**
>
> ```
> continue next chunk
> ```
>
> The agent will read this file, find the next chunk with status `not-started`,
> implement it, update the status to `done`, update `Next Chunk`, and log details
> in `rules/completion-log.md`.

> **ENFORCEMENT RULE — Completed chunks must be removed from this file.**
>
> When a chunk is marked `done`:
> 1. Log full details (date, goal, architecture, files created/modified, test counts) in `rules/completion-log.md`.
> 2. **Remove the done row from this file.** Milestones.md contains only `not-started` chunks.
> 3. If an entire phase has no remaining rows, replace the table with: `✅ Phase N complete — see completion-log.md`.
> 4. Update the `Next Chunk` section to point to the next `not-started` chunk.
>
> This rule is mandatory for every AI agent session. Never leave done rows in milestones.md.
